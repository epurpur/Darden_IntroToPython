# Darden_IntroToPython
Introduction to Python session for UVA's Darden Business School

## Who am I?
* Erich Purpur
* Research Librarian for Science & Engineering

* I'm a librarian here at UVA [Research Data Services](https://data.library.virginia.edu/rds-staff/)
    -I'm a liaison to various engineering departments. Basically, if they need stuff from the library
    I try to make it available for them.  I do quite a bit of teaching both in one off workshops like
    this, ongoing series (PhD+), and for-credit courses. I teach courses releated to python programming and
    Geographic Information Systems (GIS) I also sometimes help people with GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
    projects and programming-related questions. And do various side projects as they arise.

## Getting Python (this will take some time)
* [Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows)
* [Mac](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)

## Getting the files we are working with today
* Go here: https://github.com/epurpur/python-intro
* Click "Clone or Download" (green button in upper right corner)
* Click "Download Zip"
* Unzip that directory and move it somewhere that is easy to find (like your Desktop, for example)

# Goals for Today
1. Get python running
2. Learn some fundamentals
3. Learn how to help yourself (Most Important!)
4. Think about...Why would this help me as a manager or in a business context?


### What is Python?
From www.python.org:
"Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in 
data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, 
as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn 
syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance." 

Python is a general purpose programming language used for a huge variety of purposes. It's user community is growing rapidly!

# Why learn Python instead of other languages?
* Python is not magic. Many other languages can do what python does.
* Python is widely used and has a ton of available resources
* Python is easy to learn
* Python is general purpose (you can do a lot of different things with it)

# What are the drawbacks of Python?
* Keep in mind python does have drawbacks!
    - Speed
    - Mobile application development
* Python is general purpose (it is not optimized for performance in one specific area)
    - Python is like a Honda CR-V (I drive a CR-V). It does it all. 
        - If you are a construction worker, you might need a truck to haul tools and materials
        - If you are a race car driver, you need a sports car
    
    
# Difference between R and Python?  (Simplified)
* They are both open source programming languages
* Python is general purpose while R is focused on statistics and data analysis
* You can also do stats with Python. Many packages available
    * NumPy
    * SciPy
    * Pandas
    
    
# Why should I care as a business person?
Even if you don't intend to become a pro yourself, if you think you might be working with or managing developers, it can be 
really beneficial to at least have some working knowledge of what they do. Knowing just a little bit can go a long way!
    
A complaint heard from developers or other technical people is: "My manager is asking me to do something impossible because 
he/she doesn't understand how the code works!". Don't be that manager. 

# Important Points about Programming to Grasp
These are not specific to python

Programming allows us to...
- Interact with computers!
    - Who doesn't use a computer these days?
- Automate things (perform repetitive tasks)
    - Computers don't get bored
    - Computers don't make mistakes (humans who create them make mistakes)
- Analyze huge data sets 

When learning to program you will...
- Develop critical thinking skills
    - How do I attack the problem?
- Be forced develop a clear line of thought
    - The code only does what you tell it to do
    - If you are confused, the computer is confused
- Constantly adapt
